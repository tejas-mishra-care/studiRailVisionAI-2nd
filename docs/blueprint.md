# **App Name**: RailVision AI

## Core Features:

- Data Integration: Import and normalize static railway data (track layouts, signal configurations, rolling stock profiles). Convert data from varied formats into the unified application schema.
- Real-Time Data Stream: Continuously ingest and process live operational data (train positions, track occupancy, signal aspects, weather conditions).
- AI-Powered Traffic Prediction: Employ machine learning models to forecast future traffic conditions, anticipate potential conflicts, and estimate arrival times.
- Intelligent Route Optimization: Using ground truth state and predictive forecasts as inputs, this tool generates safe, efficient action plans that minimize network delays, while taking into consideration track restrictions, train schedules, train priorities and real-time status.
- Deterministic Safety Shield: Before any AI action is recommended to the controller, a non-AI validation engine will be used as a 'safety shield'. The engine will deterministically validate action proposals to comply with all G&SR regulations. Only actions determined as completely safe are output to operators.
- Interactive Map Interface: Visually represent the railway network with dynamic real-time data overlaid on the network (train locations, signal status, available tracks). Provide clear and concise displays of AI-generated recommendations.
- AI Recommendation Audit Trail: Maintain an immutable log of every piece of data received, decisions made by the AI engine, safety checks, and controller overrides for forensic analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep navy blue (#243A73) evokes trust, safety, and technological expertise. 
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5) provides a clean, professional backdrop and reduces eye strain during long hours.
- Accent color: Vivid sky blue (#74B9FF) highlights important elements and actionable items (buttons, alerts) and draws attention where needed. 
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) offers exceptional readability across different screen sizes, conveying objectivity.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist line icons from a library like 'Font Awesome' or 'Material Icons' for railway infrastructure elements (trains, signals, stations).
- Follow a structured layout that uses card-based containers for different modules, promoting ease of understanding and fast task completion.
- Subtle transitions and animations will indicate data updates or route recalculations, reinforcing awareness of key information without becoming distracting.
